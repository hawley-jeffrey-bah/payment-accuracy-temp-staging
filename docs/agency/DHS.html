                        <h1>Department of Homeland Security</h1>
                        <p id="executive-summary-text" class="text-truncate">
                            In the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, Congress passed the Homeland Security Act (P.L. 107-296), which established the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and combined the functions of 22 Federal departments and agencies with broad responsibilities to secure the Nation from threats. Since its inception, the Department has evolved into the third largest Cabinet agency and has matured its mission areas to collectively prevent attacks, mitigate threats, respond to national emergencies, and preserve economic security. The threats to our homeland have evolved over the 21 years of the Department of Homeland Security. One constant is the legacy of service of our workforce. They’ve delivered results for America every day since 2003 and continue to contribute to a safer tomorrow for all Americans. <br />
<br />
While we continue to face the threat of international terrorism, new threats and challenges have emerged, including increasing incidents of targeted violence, cyberattacks and several natural disasters, as well as the unprecedented level of transnational organized crime in our hemisphere. The 260,000-strong DHS workforce uses its skills and expertise to meet the challenges of today’s world and prepare for the threats of tomorrow, responding with new programs and capabilities, cross-Component collaboration, and unflinching dedication to the mission: to secure the nation from the many threats we face. Today, DHS spans over two dozen agencies and offices that work collaboratively to protect the American public in the air by securing air travel; on land by securing the border, responding to natural disasters, protecting critical infrastructure, and administering our nation’s legal immigration system; at sea by protecting our coastline and waterways; and in cyberspace by bolstering America’s cyber defense and investigating cybercrime. As the complex threat environment continues to evolve and loom, the Department will embody the relentless resilience of the American people to ensure a safe, secure, and prosperous Homeland supported by the six overarching homeland security missions that make up our strategic plan: <br />
<br />
1.	Counter Terrorism and Homeland Security Threats <br />
2.	Secure United States (U.S.) Borders and Approaches <br />
3.	Secure Cyberspace and Critical Infrastructure <br />
4.	Preserve and Uphold the Nation's Prosperity and Economic Security <br />
5.	Strengthen Preparedness and Resilience <br />
6.	Champion the DHS Workforce and Strengthen the Department <br />
<br />
We face more serious threats from nation states now than at any time in the Department's history. DHS is bringing together its authorities and capabilities across DHS Component agencies to counter those threats, including enforcing U.S. trade laws banning the importation of goods made, wholly or in part, with forced labor, strengthening maritime governance, and increasing awareness of nation state threats with our federal, state, local, tribal, territorial, and private sector partners. The nation also faces threats from the impacts of climate change causing more frequent and severe weather events, and from emerging infectious diseases. <br />
<br />
In 2017, the nation faced a historic Atlantic hurricane season. The effects from consecutive hurricanes Harvey, Irma and Maria were widespread, causing long-lasting damage across the southern continental U.S. and surrounding islands, as well as Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands. Supplemental appropriations were designated as an emergency requirement in the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements, 2017 (P.L. 115-56), the Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act of 2017 (P.L. 115-72), and the Further Additional Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements Act, 2018 (P.L. 115-123) were issued to specific agencies to provide the resources needed to recover and rebuild following recent hurricanes and other applicable natural disasters. Within these supplemental appropriations, DHS received a total supplemental appropriation amount of $50.72 billion. Per the language of the supplemental appropriations, once disaster supplemental funded programs initially met or exceeded the $10 million disbursement threshold for payments applicable for Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) review for the 12-month reporting period, the program was deemed susceptible to significant improper payments and thus applicable for statistical sampling and reporting. Since the Supplemental Appropriations for Disaster Relief Requirements disbursement activity began, the Department has identified and monitored programs that have expended more than $10 million in applicable outlays in any given fiscal year (FY). <br />
<br />
In 2020, our Nation faced one of the biggest threats in recent history—the COVID-19 pandemic. In a swift response, Congress provided $2 trillion in supplemental funding through the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, an economic relief package. As the executer of over $45 billion in CARES Act funding, DHS was at the epicenter in the Federal Government’s response to the pandemic and worked closely with other federal agencies, state, local, tribal, and territorial governments to distribute the much-needed funding. In FY 2020, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) activated the National Response Coordination Center (NRCC) in the wake of the Coronavirus outbreak in the United States. The NRCC is a multi-agency center that coordinates the overall federal support for major incidents and emergencies. NRCC also provides a clearinghouse of resources and policies for local and state governments in impacted regions. <br />
<br />
In FY 2021, DHS Components received over $50 billion in funding from the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) with the majority allotted to the FEMA Disaster Relief Fund (DRF). The DRF is an appropriation used to direct, coordinate, manage, and fund eligible response and recovery efforts associated with domestic major disasters and emergencies. In addition, the FEMA DRF received over $19 billion from the Consolidated Appropriations Act (CAA) to carry out disaster relief activity, including COVID-19 related activity. <br />
<br />
FEMA provided front-line support for the U.S. response to the pandemic through mass vaccination sites and providing coordination across the FEMA regions. The COVID-19 Pandemic Operational Guidance issued during the 2020 Hurricane Season, outlines how FEMA has adapted its response and recovery operations in a COVID-19 environment. At the same time, this guidance has other implications moving forward, for example, providing a workforce mix for any future scenarios similar to the response during this pandemic. The Pandemic Operational Guidance also helps to shape a shared understanding among local and regional emergency managers and FEMA about roles and expectations in such deployments. The pandemic impacts current and future requirements for response and recovery logistics and products, such as determining eligible work and costs for non- congregate sheltering in response to a Presidentially declared emergency or major disaster, processing grants, how to manage communications, and training during such responses, and employing tools requiring limited on-site presence—such as satellite imagery—to assess damage. <br />
<br />
The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular No. A-123, Appendix C, “Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement”, serves as the implementing guidance to ensure that legislative requirements within PIIA are sufficiently addressed. Per OMB Circular No. A-123, Appendix C, agencies should assess all programs with annual outlays greater than $10 million for improper payment risk at least once every three years to determine whether the total annual Improper Payments (IPs) plus Unknown Payments (UPs) collectively for each program are likely to be above or below the statutory threshold for the given year. As part of the DHS risk assessment process, all programs are subject to a preliminary risk assessment which serves to determine if the program has been subject to significant changes, fluctuations, new requirements, etc. that could have substantially altered the program’s susceptibility to making significant improper payments, even in off-cycle years. If the preliminary risk assessment indicates a need to reassess the risk of the program or if the program is due for an updated assessment due to the three-year frequency cycle, DHS will then move the program into the comprehensive risk assessment process. In 2024, DHS completed a comprehensive risk assessment for 48 programs out of the over 90 programs that exceeded $10 million in annual outlays. Upon completion of the comprehensive risk assessment process, only one program was determined to be newly susceptible to significant improper payments and will be converted to Phase 2 for statistical testing and reporting in 2025. <br />
<br />
Due to the burden of testing and reporting for the programs impacted heavily by disaster supplemental appropriation disbursements, DHS is generally reporting statistical testing results two years in arrears. While supporting the mission, DHS remains strongly committed to ensuring our agency’s transparency and accountability to the American taxpayer and achieving the most cost-effective strategy on the reduction of improper payments. For specifics regarding changes in reporting for specific programs as well as program results, please refer to the program level reporting. In comparison to prior year reporting, DHS has: <br />
<br />
a)	Removed one program from PIIA Phase 2 reporting as the program has been adequately baselined under PIIA requirements and has been determined to not be susceptible to significant improper payments and thus reverted to PIIA Phase 1, effective for the 2024 reporting period.<br />
•	FEMA Hazard Mitigation Grant Program (HMGP) – Disaster Supplemental Funds <br />
<br />
b)	Continued PIIA Phase 2 reporting for one program, based on FY 2022 disbursement activity, effective for the 2024 reporting period.<br />
•	U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Procurement, Construction, and Improvements (PC&I) – Disaster Supplemental Funds<br />
<br />
c)	Added one program into PIIA Phase 2 reporting based on FY 2022 disbursement activity, effective for the 2024 reporting period.<br />
•	FEMA Funeral Assistance <br />
<br />
d)	Initiated catch-up PIIA Phase 2 reporting for one program, to cover FY 2021 and FY 2022 disbursement activity, effective for the 2024 reporting period. <br />
•	FEMA Public Assistance – Validate as You Go (VAYGo) <br />
<br />
e)	Determined one program has met the criteria per the agency’s risk assessment process to be deemed susceptible to significant improper payments and thus will be moved to Phase 2 for the 2025 reporting period.<br />
•	Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) PC&I – Disaster Supplemental Funds<br />
<br />
For the 2024 reporting of Phase 2 programs, DHS is publishing an improper payment estimates for a total of three programs. All program disbursement activity subject to assessment and reporting in 2024 included outlay activity from FY 2022 but due to the delay in FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo reporting in the prior year, that program is publishing 24-month assessment coverage and error reporting to also include coverage for disbursements made in FY 2021. Overall, DHS conducted assessments over more than $41.4 billion in disbursement activity with over 96 percent of disbursements being deemed proper. As such, DHS is reporting an agency-wide error rate of approximately 3.84 percent in 2024. As highlighted in the program specific reporting, the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program accounts for just under 96 percent of the disbursement amount that was reviewed by the agency and contributed to just over 96 percent of the DHS total IP and UP reported totals. The primary root causes for errors identified during the 2024 assessment and reporting period were:<br />
•	Unable to Determine whether the Payment is Proper or Improper due to Insufficient Documentation (categorized as Unknown Payments) – estimated error amount of just under $1.4 billion accounting for over 87 percent of the total DHS reported error rate<br />
•	Failure to Access Data or Information (categorized as Improper Payments) – estimated error amount of just under $195.3 million accounting for over 12 percent of the total DHS reported error rate <br />
<br />
To address the issues surrounding insufficient documentation, FEMA continues to work with recipients and applicants on obtaining additional information and missing documentation for the UPs. FEMA remains committed to streamlining and automating the program processes, training relevant parties and stakeholders, ensuring that policy and process documentation is current and available, and maintaining consistent and regular oversight through internal reviews and audit activity while not overburdening grant recipients and assistance applicants. With the two major programs contributing solely to the 2024 estimated error rates for the agency, please refer to the program level reporting for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and the FEMA Funeral Assistance program for additional detail regarding granular root causes, corrective actions taken, corrective actions planned, and for additional context related to the payment environment and integrity of the program. <br />
<br />
Finally, in 2024 the DHS Office of the Inspector General (OIG) completed its evaluation to determine the Department’s compliance with PIIA requirements based off of the FY 2023 reporting. The DHS OIG determined that DHS complied with 9 out of 10 PIIA requirements and did not have any programs reporting above the statutory threshold. The OIG noted a non-compliance related to the requirement to publish IP and UP estimates for programs susceptible to significant improper payments. Specifically, DHS did not comply with the requirement to publish IP and UP estimates for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program in FY 2023 due to the delay in PIIA reporting, highlighted above. <br />
<br />
The DHS OIG made two recommendations to improve DHS's compliance with the PIIA related to 1) ensuring the testing and reporting of improper payments and unknown payments of the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and 2) ensuring that DHS follows the OMB reporting requirements for programs determined to be noncompliant with PIIA as stated in Appendix C of OMB Circular No. A-123. DHS concurred with both recommendations and at the time of the OIG compliance report publication, the recommendations were considered open and resolved. Overall, DHS, at a summary level, is taking the following actions to resolve the OIG recommendations: <br />
•	DHS will complete the PIIA Phase 2 assessment over the FY 2021 disbursements made by the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program and publish an error estimate as part of the Department’s FY 2024 reporting.<br />
•	DHS will follow the OMB requirements for a first-year noncompliant program, to include describing the actions that FEMA will take to achieve compliance for the FEMA Public Assistance – VAYGo program as part of the OMB annual data call for publication on PaymentAccuracy.gov. <br />
<br />
Based on the timeline for actions to come into compliance, the majority of the associated activities are expected to be fully completed in the FY 2024 PIIA reporting cycle.

                            Internal recovery activities performed by DHS include, but are not limited to, grant and contract closeout processes, Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) testing, self-reporting by vendors, duplicate payment reviews, usage of Do Not Pay capabilities and monitoring, etc. Although collection methods vary by Components and programs, DHS utilizes a broad array of approaches and tools to recover overpayments once identified. For programs that utilized Treasury’s Invoice Payment Processing (IPP) system, the payment off-set can be utilized to off-set the overpayment amount against a to-be paid invoice to the same vendor in the system. In addition, the Treasury reclamation process is used once a receivable established to recover an overpayment has aged and can be referred for Treasury collection processing. DHS widely utilizes the accounts receivable process to generate a receivable that then prompts a collection notification process. Notifications and/or dunning letters are sent on a prescribed frequency in an attempt to recover the overpayment amount. When the above approaches are unsuccessful, there are occasions where legal involvement is required that may include a judgement collection and/or a contract suspension.
