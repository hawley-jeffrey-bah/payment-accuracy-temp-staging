                        <h1>Department of Defense Military Programs</h1>
                        <p id="executive-summary-text" class="text-truncate">
                            The Department of Defense (DoD or the Department) met the overarching intent of the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) and Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Circular A-123, Appendix C.  Payment Integrity has been a top management priority, with the development of effective methodologies to identify, prevent, and recover improper payments. <br />
<br />
In the fiscal year (FY) 2023 PIIA compliance audit, the Department successfully met five out of six compliance criteria.  To achieve full PIIA compliance, the Department has adopted two strategic paths, incorporating the OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C, Phase 1 (Risk Assessments) and Phase 2 (Sampling & Estimation) approaches. <br />
<br />
In FY 2024, the Department restructured its entire Payment Integrity portfolio, integrating the results and recommendations from the DoD Office of Inspector General’s (OIG) previous audit findings and interagency lessons learned.  The aim was to bring improper payment (IP) and unknown payment (UP) rates below the PIIA statutory threshold.  The Department established these Payment Integrity programs to enhance the accuracy and efficiency of Payment Integrity reporting while streamlining Department resources and striving towards achieving compliance with the PIIA and OMB guidance. <br />
<br />
The Department’s current payment integrity portfolio consists of 48 separate programs, including 42 Phase 1 programs and six Phase 2 programs.  In FY 2023, three Phase 1 programs completed their risk assessments and achieved PIIA compliance, moving them to a three-year cycle.  In FY 2024, 20 programs completed improper payment risk assessments and determined that they were not likely to be susceptible to significant improper and unknown payments.  The Department aims to complete risk assessments for the remaining 19 programs in FY 2025.  By identifying low-risk programs and placing them in Phase 1 reporting, the Department can allocate resources more efficiently and focus on high-risk Phase 2 programs. <br />
<br />
In FY 2024, the Department’s six Phase 2 programs identified $256.0 billion in payments or outlays subject to testing under the PIIA and estimated a proper payment rate of 99.58 percent ($255.9 billion).  The IP rate was approximately 0.25 percent ($635.3 million), and the UP rate was approximately 0.17 percent ($451.4 million).  The Department employed a statistical methodology recommended by the DoD OIG to develop these FY 2024 IP and UP results, which tested more high-risk payment samples.  The overarching goal is to achieve PIIA compliance, specifically compliance criteria #3, by publishing IP and UP estimates for programs susceptible to significant IPs and UPs in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.  <br />
<br />
The Department prevented all the Phase 2 programs from becoming a high priority program in FY 2024 through its continued efforts to identify error root causes, focus on controls that detect and prevent overpayments, implement or reinforce applicable processes and procedures, and train staff on policy guidance and best practices.<br />
<br />
The Department has dedicated considerable effort to identifying and recovering $1,827.4 million in monetary losses, successfully recovering $1,684.0 million through its Payment Recovery Audits and Activities program.  This achievement underscores the Department’s commitment to proper stewardship of funding and demonstrates the effectiveness of its recovery initiatives.  <br />

                        <br />
                        The main objective of the Department’s Payment Recovery Audit (PRA) program is to identify, recapture, and reallocate overpayments made by Department of Defense (DoD) Components in support of the DoD mission, while simultaneously demonstrating financial stewardship of resources. The Department’s PRA program consists of a combination of cost-effective internal controls implemented by DoD Components, PIIA-related initiatives, and recoveries performed by TRICARE private sector contractors. The Department’s PRA efforts are a synchronization of actions taken by DoD Components with additional collection activities performed by the Defense Finance and Accounting Service, Defense Health Agency, and US Army Corps of Engineers.
