                        <h1>Department of Labor</h1>
                        <p id="executive-summary-text" class="text-truncate">
                            In FY23, the Department of Labor’s (DOL), Office of Inspector General (DOL-OIG) found the Department’s Federal-State Unemployment Insurance (UI) program "non-compliant" with certain criteria in PIIA. DOL’s response to DOL-OIG's findings are detailed in Management's Response to the OIG's draft report.<br />
<br />
In FY24 DOL found two programs to be "susceptible to significant improper payments (IP)". These are 1) the Employment and Training Administration - Federal State UI program, and 2) the Office of Workers' Compensation - Federal Employees' Compensation Act (FECA) program. <br />
<br />
DOL Overview<br />
DOL conducts a program inventory annually and conducts risk assessments of all identified programs on a minimum triennial basis as required by M-21-19. In FY24, DOL identified one new program, Bureau of Labor Statistics - Headquarters Relocation meeting the $10,000,000 threshold for risk assessment and public reporting in FY24, nor were any programs newly determined to be "susceptible to significant IP". DOL’s FY24 Program Inventory also identified another program, Employment & Training Administration - Community Projects, which exceeded the $10M outlays threshold in PIIA for the first time per FY24 reporting. Per M-21-19 requirements a program must exist for a full year before risk assessment and reporting is required. However, a preliminary risk assessment found it to be not susceptible. Further Risk Assessment and reporting is anticipated for FY25 if outlays continue to meet legal thresholds.  <br />
<br />
Unemployment Insurance (UI) programs: <br />
DOL bases the Federal-State UI improper payment estimates on results of the Benefit Accuracy Measurement (BAM) survey, which examines a nationwide statistically valid sample of payments made in the three largest permanently authorized unemployment compensation programs: State UI program, Unemployment Compensation for Federal Employees (UCFE), and Unemployment Compensation for Ex-service members (UCX). The BAM sample does not include payments made under episodic programs such as Extended Benefits (EB) and temporary programs like the Emergency Unemployment Compensation (EUC) program and the UI-related programs created by the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act of 2020, including Pandemic Unemployment Assistance (PUA), Pandemic Emergency Unemployment Compensation (PEUC), Federal Pandemic Unemployment Compensation (FPUC), and Mixed-Earners Unemployment Compensation (MEUC) programs. As a result, the $35,196.6M in reported outlays for 2024 include $34,949.69M in outlays from the regular Federal-State UI program and $246.92M in outlays from the UCFE and UCX programs.<br />
<br />
The period of benefits coverage for all pandemic-related UI programs, including PUA, PEUC, FPUC, and MEUC, expired in law on September 6, 2021, though some states stopped offering these benefits prior to that date. States continued to work backlogs, adjudicate and pay benefits, resolve appeals, and determine and collect overpaid benefits under these temporary programs in the current reporting period. Several pandemic-related UI programs report negative outlays, which is due to states’ ongoing overpayment recovery efforts. Since the total outlays for each of the pandemic-related programs were less than $10,000,000, no specific data is reported for these programs on PaymentAccuracy.gov. These negative outlays were not used to artificially reduce normal UI program reported outlays nor impact IP estimates. However, for transparency purposes, DOL is reporting the program outlays for the pandemic-related UI programs and other temporary and episodic UI programs here:<br />
EB = $12.06M<br />
EUC = $0.14M<br />
FPUC = $-1,852.87M<br />
MEUC = $0.43M<br />
PEUC = $-269.75M<br />
PUA = $-1,737.83M<br />
<br />
The PUA program was determined "susceptible" in FY21. DOL submitted a Sampling and Estimation Methodology Plan (S&EMP) for estimating the PUA program’s improper payment rate and amount to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on June 30, 2022. In October 2022, OMB requested that DOL conduct further analysis of the outcomes recorded through the PUA case review process. OMB and DOL agreed to collaborate in conducting this additional analysis. In direct collaboration with OMB, the Employment and Training Administration (ETA) updated the PUA S&EMP. OMB accepted the update and DOL published information on the methodology and the IP estimation on August 21, 2023.<br />
<br />
FY23 Payment Integrity reporting for PUA was census reporting covering the full life of the weeks of eligibility of the program from its beginning through its expiration in law on September 6, 2021 (though many states terminated the program earlier). Because the program is expired in law and no longer active, no further payment integrity action is possible, nor is it possible to provide an updated improper payment rate under the S&EMP. Consistent with the prior year’s Agency Financial Report and PaymentAccuracy.gov reporting, DOL Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) determined that no further annual payment integrity PaymentAccuracy.gov reporting is possible. In its PIIA compliance report, DOL-OIG recommended reporting PUA regardless.  However, if DOL were to do so, it would result in reporting consisting almost entirely of “NA” responses since the program has expired. To address DOL-OIG’s concern and to be transparent in sharing information, DOL is providing the outlays for FY2024 in the PUA program. As noted above, the amount of the PUA outlays is $-1,737.83M. DOL would apply the previously estimated 18.53% IP rate, which was developed for the life of the PUA program, to any PUA outlays – however this is not applicable to negative outlays. DOL notified OMB of the decision to reclassify FPUC, PEUC, and PUA as Phase 0 and is not expected to provide further reporting under M-21-19.

                            Only the Office of Unemployment Insurance (OUI) has determined that a recovery audit program is cost effective. OUI reports the dollar amount of overpayments recovered through recovery audit during the reporting period as being used for the original purpose. Any state UI dollars recovered are returned to state UI trust funds for use for the original purpose. Any federal UC funds are returned to Treasury for use for the original purpose. OUI does not capture data on recovery aging to determine amounts determined uncollectable for overpayments identified in prior reporting periods.<br />

Other recovery activity data provided here is based on OCFO action. Component agencies may conduct recovery activities which are not tracked.<br />

                        <h5>Methods Currently Used to Recover Overpayments Identified in Recovery Audits</h5>
                        <br />
                        With oversight from the Employment and Training Administration (ETA), each state Unemployment Insurance (UI) agency is responsible for promoting and maintaining UI program integrity through prevention, detection, investigation, establishment, and recovery of improper payments. States identify and establish overpayments for recovery using methods such as crossmatching with the State Directory of New Hires, the National Directory of New Hires, the UI Integrity Center’s Integrity Data Hub, quarterly wage records submitted by employers, matches with databases such as Workers Compensation, incarceration records, and other sources such as tips and leads.<br />
<br />
State UI laws provide for overpayment recovery and states are required to follow their individual state laws and policies in executing recovery efforts. ETA requires states to report quarterly on overpayment detection and recovery activities, including information on actual amounts of UI overpayments established and recovered.<br />
<br />
States are required to hold claimants liable to repay improperly received benefits and take an active role to<br />
 <br />
recover improper payments. Overpayment recovery is critical to protect both state UI trust funds and federal funds and ETA has reminded states that overpayment recovery must be given the same priority as fraud prevention and detection activities. States may waive recovery of non-fraud overpayments when it would be against equity and good conscience pursuant to their state’s law. States may also waive recovery of certain non-fraud overpayments under the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security (CARES) Act, as amended, in accordance with federal guidance (see Unemployment Insurance Program Letter (UIPL) No. 20-21 and 20-21, Change 1). Under no circumstances may a state waive recovery activities for a fraudulent overpayment.<br />
<br />
ETA issued UIPL No. 11-23 reminding states of required and recommended program integrity functions, which includes overpayment recovery activities, for the unemployment compensation (UC) programs. ETA requires states to use the overpayment recovery tools listed below (with citations providing ETA with authority to require such actions):<br />
•	Benefit Offsets (Title II, Subtitle A of the Middle Class Tax Relief and Job Creation Act of 2012, UIPL No. 05-13, and Section 5 of UIPL No. 13- 20, Change 2);<br />
•	Treasury Offset Program (TOP) for applicable covered debt (Bipartisan Budget Act of 2013, UIPL No. 02-19, 12-14, and 04-20);<br />
•	Cross Program Offset Recovery Agreement (CPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13); and<br />
•	Interstate Reciprocal Offset Recovery Arrangement (IPORA) (UIPL No. 05-13).<br />
<br />
ETA also strongly recommends states use the following additional overpayment recovery activities, where allowed by state law, as part of an effective overpayment recovery operation:<br />
•	Negotiating repayment plans;<br />
•	Accepting repayments through various methods (e.g. online, via debit/credit card);<br />
•	State Income Tax Offset Program;<br />
•	Wage garnishments;<br />
•	Property liens and assessments;<br />
•	Offsets of lottery winnings, homestead exemptions, and other benefits;<br />
•	Active participation in probate and/or bankruptcy proceedings regarding an individual with an outstanding overpayment;<br />
•	Skip tracing;<br />
•	Work proactively and collaboratively with banks and financial institutions to detect suspicious activity, ensure that accounts are not unduly suspended, and recover overpayments (UIPL No. 19-21);<br />
•	Civil actions;<br />
•	Credit bureau referrals;<br />
•	State/federal prosecution;<br />
•	Penalties and interest on overpayments in compliance with state and federal law;<br />
•	Collection agency referrals when state staff is limited, or debt is uncollectable by other means;<br />
•	Implementing a voluntary fraud self-disclosure program; and<br />
•	Other recovery methods as determined by state law or policy.<br />
