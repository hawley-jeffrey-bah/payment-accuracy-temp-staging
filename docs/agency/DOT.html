                        <h1>Department of Transportation</h1>
                        <p id="executive-summary-text" class="text-truncate">
                            The Department of Transportation (DOT) prioritizes payment integrity efforts and recognizes the importance of maintaining effective internal controls to ensure proper payments. Safeguarding DOT’s assets and resources reinforces the Department’s mission: To deliver the world’s leading transportation system, serving the American people and economy through the safe, efficient, sustainable, and equitable movement of people and goods. <br />
<br />
DOT is proud to report a Fiscal Year (FY) 2024 payment accuracy rate of 98.10% that compares favorably to the most recent Federal-wide payment accuracy rate of 94.58% reported in FY 2023. The FY 2024 payment accuracy rate was below our reduction target and decreased slightly when compared to the prior year rate of 99.3%. Our reduction target aligns with the Organizational Excellence strategic objective within the Department's FY 2022-2026 Strategic Plan to ensure responsible and transparent stewardship of public resources. The plan includes an aggressive performance goal to achieve a 99% payment accuracy rate to demonstrate robust internal controls at both the Federal and grant recipient levels. <br />
<br />
For FY 2024 phase 2 programs, the Federal Highway Administration’s Highway Planning and Construction achieved a payment accuracy rate of 98.04% and the Federal Transit Administration’s Transit Infrastructure Grant – Coronavirus Disease of 2019 (COVID) Relief Funds achieved a rate of 98.44%. Both payment accuracy rates are below our 99% performance goal; yet remain within the upper and lower bounds of their historical estimates. Therefore, we view the rates for both programs to be within their historical statistical ranges and will closely monitor them against FY 2025 results to determine if any changes represent a trend that require more aggressive corrective action. <br />
<br />
Common characteristics of DOT’s programs susceptible to significant improper payments (IPs) are that both programs are administered by grant recipients, typically a State DOT or local transit authority, and that IPs are outside of our control when the grant recipients make administrative errors. Whereas grant recipients are responsible for the administration of federal assistance, DOT is responsible, primarily through its division and regional offices, for ensuring compliance with Federal requirements and proper use of Federal funds. The IP sampling and estimation process is an example of one method DOT utilizes to assess grant recipient compliance with Federal requirements and to identify emerging causes of payment integrity risk. During FY 2024, DOT’s Inspector General (OIG) concluded that our FY 2023 reports were compliant with Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requirements as prescribed by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB). The OIG will issue a report in FY 2025 with a determination on whether DOT’s FY 2024 reports were compliant with PIIA requirements.  <br />
<br />
Training and maintaining strong partnerships with our grant recipients are essential to reducing DOT’s IPs over time. DOT Operating Administrations work with grant recipients to: improve project documentation, contractual adherence, adherence of Federal regulation requirements, invoice verification, payment processes, and address training deficiencies as applicable for each IP. While robust, the internal control systems and structures of our grant recipients across the Nation must constantly evolve to meet changing Federal statutory and regulatory requirements. For example, the statutory COVID relief funding requirements established a date, January 20, 2020, for cost eligibility. While well defined, the date is quite arbitrary when applied to a grant recipient financial management systems that process retroactive pay adjustments or bundle newly eligible costs for reimbursement from a wide range of dates. Hence, continued collaboration and communication between DOT and our State and Local partners is a necessity to ensure compliance with Federal requirements including the accuracy of payment requests.<br />
<br />
DOT’s Payment Integrity Center is responsible for coordinating improper payment reviews, reporting results, and monitoring the progress of corrective actions in accordance with PIIA, OMB Circular No. A-123 Appendix C, Requirements for Payment Integrity Improvement, and OMB Circular No. A-136, Financial Reporting Requirements. The Integrity Center’s trend analysis of overall disbursements by Treasury code and monitoring of DOT spending reports identifies and validates new, as well as significant payment changes to existing programs. Annually, the Integrity Center performs a Department-wide payment analysis based on monthly Treasury statements (MTS). The Integrity Center also monitors spending reports available to the public on DOT’s webpage. Two publicly available reports include the: USDOT COVID-19 Relief Funding and Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL) Funding Status report. <br />
<br />
In addition to monitoring program spending and estimating IPs for 2 programs, the Department: performed an IP risk assessment, conducted a payment recovery audit, monitored the progress of corrective actions, analyzed confirmed fraud cases, and screened payments against the Do Not Pay databases. DOT phase 1 programs must perform an IP risk assessment at a minimum once every three years unless there is a program or funding change. Most of DOT’s programs completed triennial risk assessment cycle during FY 2023 with 1 program assessed in FY 2024 as not susceptible to significant improper payments. For FY 2025, the DOT Payment Integrity Center plans perform annual requirements, monitor implementation of corrective actions developed in FY 2024, and report IP estimates for its 2 programs that continue to be susceptible to significant improper payments. We take pride in our payment integrity efforts and remain committed to strengthening our payment processing controls going forward.

                        <br />
                        Federal personnel within DOT’s Payment Integrity Center performed the recovery audit focusing on DOT payments made between April 2023 through March 2024. DOT considers all overpayments identified through the fiscal year 2024 audit to be recoverable. The Enterprise Service Center (ESC), DOT’s service provider, typically recoups overpayments resulting from DOT errors directly from the payee, by offsetting a payee’s future payment, or by submitting a debt to the Department of Treasury’s Offset Program. In most cases, ESC can recover overpayments directly from the payees. In fiscal year 2024, recaptured overpayments resulting from DOT errors were returned to the program or activity’s original purpose.
