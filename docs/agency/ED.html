                        <h1>Department of Education</h1>
                        <p id="executive-summary-text" class="text-truncate">
                            Federal Student Aid's (FSA’s) Federal Pell Grant (Pell) and William D. Ford Direct Loan (Direct Loan) programs are considered Phase 2 programs per OMB Circular A-123, Appendix C (“A-123C”). The major causes of improper payments (IP) and unknown payments (UP) in FY 2024 are related to misreported income, credit balance deficiencies, incorrect financial aid determination, and student withdrawal deficiencies. These root causes are consistent with those identified for prior year IP and UP estimates. FSA has developed corrective action plans to mitigate and prevent IPs and UPs that are within FSA’s control. For example, through the Student Aid and Borrower Eligibility (SABER) Initiative, FSA has implemented the Fostering Undergraduate Talent by Unlocking Resources for Education (FUTURE) Act and Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) Simplification Act for the 2024-2025 FAFSA which streamlines and strengthens the collection of data used to determine eligibility for student financial assistance. IPs and UPs that are outside of FSA’s control are mainly attributed to challenges at institutions that are responsible for disbursing Pell and Direct Loan funds. FSA will continue to provide training to institutions through various avenues, such as the FSA Annual Conference, and perform various oversight activities to ensure institutions meet FSA requirements for institutional eligibility, financial responsibility, and administrative capability.  <br />
<br />
The FY 2024 IP and UP rate for the Pell program is 2.64% down from 2.83% in FY 2023. The decrease in the FY 2024 Pell estimate from the FY 2023 is primarily due to a decrease in IPs as derived from compliance audit data. The FY2024 IP and UP rate for the Direct Loan program is 0.94%, up from 0.70% in FY 2023.  The increase in the FY 2024 Direct Loan estimate from FY 2023 is primarily due to an increase in IPs as derived from compliance audit data.  <br />
<br />
The Department also estimated the FY 2024 IP and UP rates for one non-FSA Phase 2 program: Education Stabilization Fund (ESF). The FY 2024 IP and UP rate for the ESF program is 0.00015%. The ESF program experienced overpayments that were beyond the agency’s control, due to automatic rounding errors. These discrepancies occurred both within Excel and other system-based processes. Preventing rounding within system-based processes is inherently challenging. When rounding occurs in a system and is subsequently recalculated in Excel, discrepancies can arise, resulting in minor differences in amounts. Consequently, it is difficult for states to prevent these rounding errors, which is why they are classified as beyond the agency’s control.  <br />
<br />
In FY 2023, the Department implemented measures to reduce unknown payments, the predominant reason for the Title I, Part A, Grants to Local Educational Agencies program’s high improper payment estimate reported in FY22. The Department worked with state educational agencies (SEAs) to produce sufficient documentation for any advanced payments. Additionally, there were no unknown payments reported for FY23 for the Special Education Grants to States program. With the Department’s OIG’s determination of FY23 compliance with the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA), both of these programs moved from Phase 2 (estimation) to Phase 1 (risk assessment).  <br />
<br />
The Department continues its efforts to collect confirmed IPs. Although the Department has determined that payment recapture audits would not be cost effective for any of its programs and activities, the Department identifies and recovers IPs through other recovery mechanisms. The Department works with grantees and Title IV (FSA) program participants to resolve and recover amounts identified in compliance audits, OIG audits, and program reviews. Additionally, the Department analyzes the return of grant funds from recipients to determine if they are due to IPs. When an IP is confirmed and deemed collectable, the Department establishes an account receivable and pursues collection. Additionally, the Department has wide discretion to decide not to collect IPs from grantees in cases where it determines that pursuing collections would cause more harm to the federal interest. <br />
<br />
Finally, by performing improper payment risk assessments, the Department has not identified any new programs as high risk requiring an estimate. The Department continues to maintain PIIA compliance by emphasizing prevention of improper payments. Excessive drawdowns can reveal grantee cash management issues, an area where the Department’s grants management community continues to address through its technical assistance to grantees.
