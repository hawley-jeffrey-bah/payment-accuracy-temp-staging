                            In FY 2024 the EPA was found compliant with the requirements of the Payment Integrity Information Act by the agency's OIG. By the end of this fiscal year, the one program (the Grants Program) identified as potentially susceptible to significant improper payments, was determined to not be susceptible as result of a statistical sample of its payments. <br />
To sustain the Payment Integrity at the EPA, the agency maintains a proactive process of conducting regular risk assessments of its programs and expecting regular, ongoing payment reviews. For practical purposes, the EPA mostly aligns its programs by payment processes. Using that as a starting point, each year, the agency reviews the funding and outlays’ mechanisms of its programs, as well as each program’s purpose to determine if they are sufficiently similar and appropriately sized for proper assessment. For example, a new program could be split out from its current program area due to increase funding while other programs could be merged when the overlap of their processes and/or significant decreases in their funding become apparent.<br />
All of EPA’s current programs are assessed at least once every three years using a standard, qualitative risk assessment survey tool. Any new program that has been in place for 12 months and has exceeded $10 million in outlays per annum also completes the qualitative risk assessment. The survey tool is based on risk factors outlined in the payment integrity statute plus two other risk factors the agency added for potential concerns specific to the EPA. <br />
Programs that are determined to be susceptible based on the results of the qualitative risk assessment, must then carry out (quantitative) transacting testing using a statistically valid sample of its payments to determine if there is in fact a significant level of improper payments. If the results of the sample conclude the program is making a significant level of improper payments, it must develop and carry out a corrective action plan to reduce the level of improper payments. This process repeats annually for susceptible programs until the it is no longer making a significant amount of improper payments.<br />
In FY 2024, the EPA completed risk assessments on three of its programs. Two programs, the Clean School Bus – Rebates program and the agency’s Settlements program completed qualitative risk assessments using the survey tool. The results of these risk assessments determined that neither program is likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments. Nonetheless, through this risk assessment process, the CSB – Rebates program identified some challenges to its payment processes, and opted to begin countermeasures to address them prior to the formal completion of the risk assessment process.<br />
The third program, the agency’s Grants program had been identified in the FY 2023 as potentially likely to be susceptible to significant improper payments based the results of the qualitative risk assessment completed that year. In FY 2024, the program completed a review of a (statistically valid) sample of its payments. The results showed it had an improper payment rate of 0.77% which is below the susceptibility threshold of 1.5% of its payments.<br />
In addition to annually reviewing how the EPA breaks out its programs, each program is required to continuously review its payments to determine if there have been any improper payments. For any overpayments identified, the programs pursue recovery of those funds. <br />
A second and third statistical sample occurred in the Clean Water State Revolving Fund (CWSRF) and the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund (DWSRF). In recent years the each SRF has completed a ‘50-state’ judgmental sample of the payment draws as a part of its payments reviews. <br />
Additionally, in Fiscal Year 2024, due to the significant funding increase from the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) together with the statute’s expansion of funding for water systems' related work (such as lead pipe service line replacement and addressing emerging contaminants), although not required, the EPA decided to complete statistical samples for the CWSRF and DWSRF programs that received IIJA funding. Each statistical sample also layered in judgmental samples to further assure that each state would have at least one of each payment type reviewed.<br />
Looking forward to FY 2025, as examples of two proactive measures, rather than merely doing qualitative risk assessments, the EPA will conduct the more rigorous statistical sampling of two new programs (Greenhouse Gas Reduction Funds and Environmental Justice Grant Funds) that have received substantial resources under the Inflation Reduction Act and Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.<br />
