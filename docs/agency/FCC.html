                        <h1>Federal Communications Commission</h1>
                        <p id="executive-summary-text" class="text-truncate">
                            In accordance with the Improper Payment Information Act (IPIA) of 2002, as amended by the Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Act (IPERA) of 2010, Improper Payments Elimination and Recovery Improvement Act (IPERIA) of 2012, and the Payment Integrity Information Act (PIIA) of 2019, the Commission has made significant efforts to implement policies and procedures to strengthen internal controls that prevent improper payments.  In addition, the Commission utilizes a payment recapture program that includes both audits and transaction testing to search for and recapture overpayments.  Although the Commission has made strides to improve policies, procedures and controls over improper payments, there is still more work to be done.<br />
In FY2023, the Commission had four programs that were in phase 2 reporting which included: (Universal Service Fund (USF-High Cost Legacy), (USF-Lifeline), (USF-Schools and Libraries) and the Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS).  As of FY2024, the Commission now has only two programs that meet the phase 2 reporting criteria. Those programs are the USF-High Cost Legacy program and the USF-Lifeline program.  <br />
USF-High Cost legacy – The High Cost Legacy fund is the most complex program.  The improper payment increased slightly from 2.87% to 4.46% do mainly to carriers having inadequate documentation for their assets, the incorrect depreciation method being used and the lack of documentation.  In FY21, the Commission split the high cost program into two distinct programs based on the guidance from our OIG and OMB (high cost modernized and high cost legacy).  The High Cost Legacy program continues to be subject to significant risks at this time.  The Commission and our Administrator, the Universal Service Administrative Company (USAC), continues to focus their efforts on program integrity assurance activities such as collaborating with their Audit and Assurance Division partners to provide the annual circle of life webinars, meeting with the National Exchange Carrier Association and the continuation of existing analysis and data validations for the High Cost Legacy fund.  The high cost program has introduced a new compliance layer by developing additional program integrity assurance (PIA) procedures leveraging enhanced analytics and testing capabilities on a sample basis to identify potential violations.      <br />
USF-Lifeline – The USF-Lifeline program has shown significant progress over the years, although this year the program’s improper payment rate increased from 2.18% to 5.98%.  The main causes for the increase include subscriber eligibility documentation loss in the National Lifeline Accountability Database (NLAD) due to a documentation loss incident, suspicious eligibility documentation and eligibility of participants accepted by a National Verifier opt-out state due to the use of old or outdated benefit identification cards (BIC).  The Lifeline program management continues to review the root cause of the errors identified in the assessments and continues to perform updates to training and materials related to the review of eligibility documentation and provide individual coaching for reviewers.  Since the program quality assurance (PQA) review period, USAC has increased quality assurance (QA) volumes to achieve a statistically valid, random sample for each eligibility program (Medicaid, SNAP, etc.) each month.  This allows USAC to see trends by program and target training/coaching more effectively.  USAC also just implemented a mandatory, semi-annual training for all manual review agents which will be a refresher training with focus on any concerning trends coming out of QA analysis.<br />
USF-Schools and Libraries – The USF-Schools and Libraries program has reported an improper payment rate below the statutory threshold of 1.5% and $10 million for the first time since inception.  This year’s improper payment rate was 1.27% which is down from the previous year of 1.59%.  Although USAC and the Commission have made great strides in this program, there is still more work that can be done to keep the improper payment rate below the statutory thresholds.  The top two findings this year relate to competitive bidding of contracts and internal connection violations.  As corrective actions, the Schools and Libraries program continues the use of data analytics to identify potential competitive bidding violations and leverages the analytics to improve competitive bidding training and enhanced compliance through the addition of related web and training content.  The Schools and Libraries program continues to expand invoice pre-payment reviews to confirm internal connections are installed and operating.<br />
Telecommunications Relay Service (TRS) – The TRS program continues to be below the statutory limits and is currently in phase 1 reporting criteria.<br />
The Commission and its components continue to make great strides when it comes to oversight, internal control updates and implementation of policies and procedures.  Our ultimate goal is to bring all of our programs back to phase 1 reporting requirements although there is more work to be done in order to reach the goal.  With the Commission leadership, we continue to make much needed improvements in all of our programs each year.  The Commission takes seriously the recommendations provided by our OIG and its auditor so that our programs are in compliance with the guidance outlined in OMB M-21-19. <br />
