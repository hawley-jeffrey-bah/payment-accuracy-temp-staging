                        <p id="executive-summary-text" class="text-truncate">
                            In FY 2024, HUD conducted a comprehensive risk assessment of its disbursement processes and programs using FY 2023 payment data. This rigorous assessment revealed no additional programs susceptible to significant improper payments, a significant achievement considering that prior-year analyses had identified two such programs. <br />
<br />
The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) embarked on a critical mission: to ensure the integrity of its payment systems and safeguard taxpayer dollars while effectively delivering essential housing assistance. This journey, mandated by the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA), proved far more complex than initially anticipated, especially concerning Multifamily rental assistance programs, as well as the Tenant Based Rental Assistance program. Specifically, the Multifamily portfolio   is comprised of (Section 8, Section 202, and Section 811), and will be referred to as project-based rental assistance (PBRA). The sheer scale and intricacy of this program presented a formidable challenge to payment integrity testing.  For the PBRA program, HUD is entrusted with the stewardship of over $15 billion in funds, that vast majority of which is paid  through contract administrators to property owners on behalf of the tenants the program serves. This multi-layered process, involving hardcopy documentation maintained by various entities introduces significant challenges for payment integrity testing.<br />
<br />
In prior years, validating payments and identifying populations for testing within PBRA was a manual, resource-intensive process, hampered by decentralized document retention and varying procedures at the contract administrators. The existing basic sub-sampling approach yielded limited insights and risked overlooking errors further down the payment chain. HUD recognized the need for a transformation and responded with a series of innovations.<br />
<br />
New templates and automation processes were introduced to streamline payment reconciliation and enhance data accuracy. The shift from basic sub-sampling to a sophisticated, statistically valid, discrete population testing methodology for FY2024 represented a significant leap forward. This approach independently tested both payment accuracy (Payee Tier) and tenant eligibility (Eligibility Tier),  providing unprecedented visibility into errors, their root causes at all levels, and precision rates. The payee tier measures the rate of accuracy of HUD payments to contract administrators, and the tenant eligibility tier measures the accuracy of contract administrator payments to property owners. This year HUD is only able to report on the payee tier payment accuracy. HUD does not yet have sufficient data to report on the eligibility tier payment accuracy. HUD aimed to reduce the burden on contract administrators while maintaining statistical validity. To protect sensitive information (PII), a secure SharePoint site was established, ensuring data privacy in the collection process from recipients. Robotic Process Automation (RPA) streamlined the tedious process of document collection and recipient coordination.<br />
<br />
The variability in the contract administrators’ processes, controls, and documentation retention amplify the risk of improper payments, especially in the Payee Tier (payments from contract administrators to property owners),    a high-risk area highlighted by both HUD and the Office of Inspector General (OIG). This prompted HUD to focus significant resources on the Payee Tier testing, understanding that heightened risk exists outside HUD’s direct control.<br />
<br />
HUD's enhanced FY2024 testing strategy did result in a reliable measurement of the Payee Tier: The Payee Tier showed a reliable (96% precision rate) unknown payment rate of a mere 0.30% ($45.2 million), significantly below statutory thresholds. This success demonstrates HUD's commitment to protecting taxpayer money. Eligibility Tier testing, however, revealed significant difficulties in retrieving evidence from the contract administrators to support the timely verification of tenant eligibility and any error rate estimation would be misleading based on a lack of precision in extrapolating an error rate.  The lack of precision prevented production of a reliable error rate for the Eligibility Tier.  As corrective actions, HUD is working to improve contract administrators’ timely evidence collection, retention, and submission through training and outreach. By implementing new technologies, refining methodologies, and engaging actively with stakeholders, HUD is not only safeguarding taxpayer dollars but also ensuring that vital housing assistance reaches those who need it most. While challenges remain, the progress made reflects HUD's dedication to transparency, efficiency, and accountability in managing its programs. HUD   will also continue working to improve the payment integrity and exploring a methodology that will ensure that tenant eligibility is accurate and reliable.   During FY 2024, HUD assessed existing technology solutions and planned improvements to determine effective controls within the Tenant Based Rental Assistance program for preventing and detecting improper payments as documented by the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan.  Currently, HUD’s Office of Public and Indian Housing (PIH) Office of Field Operations (OFO) uses the Compliance Monitoring Review (CMR) tool and the Enterprise Income Verification (EIV) system to verify and validate information, such as accurate payment standards, income eligibility, eligibility determination, in PHA tenant files for accuracy.  Public housing agency’s (PHAs) subject to reviews are selected at random and performed both on site and in the virtual environment.  HUD explored using existing reports to estimate improper payment rates.  Existing reports did not meet stringent payment integrity requirements and could not produce reliable errors with an adequate precision rate that addressed the full payment life cycle, which includes payments from HUD to public housing authorities (PHAs), from PHAs to landlords, and considerations for eligibility verification.  HUD will continue the Public and Indian Housing IT modernization plan and determine approaches to test sub-populations. By exploring other approaches for testing, such as subdividing the TBRA PHA populations, HUD will be able to support some level of testing along with modernization efforts and tailor the testing approach. HUD’s modernization plans will benefit efforts to test the full payment life cycle for both payee and eligibility tiers through improvements to HUD’s Enterprise Voucher Management System (eVMS) and the Enhanced EIV tool.<br />

                        <br />
                        Office of Healthy Homes Lead Hazard Control - Lead Hazard Reduction<br />
During grant execution, the Office of Lead Hazard Control and Healthy Homes (OLHCHH) reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation. If an improper payment is identified, the Government Technical Representative (GTR) or the COR, as applicable, provides fund recipients with documentation of the determination of the improper payment, the regulatory, grant-specific, and/or contractual basis for recovering the improper payment, a due date for recoupment, and a due-process opportunity to appeal. The appeal, if made, goes to the Grants Division Director (for grants) or the COR (for contracts), as applicable. Should the request not be appealed, or the appeal denied, and the funding recipient did not refund the improper payment, the matter would be referred to the OGC for action. <br />
During the close-out of a grant, if it is determined that a financial error occurred, the grantee is asked to provide an explanation for the problem and, if required by the GTR, the grantee submits a check to resolve the financial shortfall. The COR forwards the check and a letter of explanation to the Budget Officer for the recapturing of funds. <br />
In addition, the GTR includes a copy of the check and the letter of explanation with the close-out package to the Grants Officer. The Grants Officer documents the returned funds on form HUD-1044 (Assistance Award/Assistance). OLHCHH’s process assures quality spending and monitoring for reimbursable funding. The likelihood of improper reimbursements are low due to several reasons. OLHCHH is a reimbursement program; the funds distributed are for services that have already been completed and invoiced. Additionally, every three months, grantees submit information on work performed and provide a financial statement using the Federal Financial Report (SF-425), HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and supporting documentation. The SF-425, HUD-Part 3 Budget form, and the LOCCS VRS Request Voucher for Grant Payment (form HUD-27053) must match data in LOCCS and all totals must be the same. Under remote monitoring, a GTR performs a review to ensure accuracy, as needed. On-site monitoring is conducted once a year after a risk analysis is completed and/or high-risk is determined for each grantee. Poor performing grantees are required to submit weekly or monthly reports. During grant execution, the OLHCHH reviews grantee invoices, vouchers and supporting documentation.

Salaries and Expenses<br />
For the Payroll, Benefits and Retirement Division (PBRD), The Office of the Chief Human Capital Officer (OCHCO) reviews the unpaid report to ensure all HUD employees are paid based on their certified timecard for the Personnel Office Identifier (POI) 4408. If erroneous payments were made due to an error in personnel and benefits, OCHCO then takes the necessary action(s) to rectify the mistake. For example, OCHCO collaborates with the BFS and the Department of Agriculture’s National Finance Center (NFC) to run all the necessary reports to determine where the discrepancy was made. Once the source has been identified, OCHCO corrects the issue or determines if it is feasible to correct the improper payment. Through the PBRD quality review process, overpayments are identified and validated. Once validated and corrected through the NFC database, the debt is generated, and the employee is notified of the indebtedness. After due process, the collection process is initiated. <br />
Also, the Human Resources (HR) Division performs a quality review based on the personnel data generated from the NFC FOCUS report or NFC Reporting Center application for personnel and benefits actions. The report data is used to determine, personnel data or duty locations which will cause an overpayment for the employee. If so, the History Correction Update Processing (HCUP) system is used to correct the error, which will automatically generate a bill if it is within twenty-six (26) pay periods. Outside of the pay period timeframe, HR will manually calculate the amount owed and enter the data to be submitted to NFC via the Special Payroll Processing System (SPPS). The employee will be informed of the indebtedness; and have an opportunity to setup a payment plan. <br />
As part of the bi-weekly payroll projection process, OCFO-Budget runs reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports and flags any payroll corrections or unusual payroll activities for program budget offices. Upon request and on an ad-hoc basis, OCFO-Budget provides assistance in the correction of improper payroll payments by running reports from OBI’s repository of payroll reports (Cost and Hours report) and providing data regarding payroll corrections to program budget offices and Treasury’s ARC. <br />
The Administrative Control of Funds Policies Handbook outlines procedures and points to additional guidance program offices follow that can lead to the identification, recovery, and prevention of future improper payments.<br />

MultiFamily Notes<br />
The MFNSB is responsible for overseeing all fiscal loan servicing activities for MF and Healthcare mortgage notes assigned to the Secretary. MF and Healthcare notes include both the Mutual Mortgage Insurance /Cooperative Management Housing Insurance and General Insurance /Special Risk Insurance for financing and liquidating accounts. The FHA has contracted with a Servicing and Accounting Contractor and utilizes their proprietary-owned system to maintain records for all transactions relating to the assignment, servicing, and disposition of the MF notes portfolio. The MFNSB is responsible for overseeing all fiscal loan servicing activities for MF and Healthcare mortgage notes assigned to the Secretary. MF and Healthcare notes include both the Mutual Mortgage Insurance /Cooperative Management Housing Insurance and General Insurance /Special Risk Insurance for financing and liquidating accounts. The FHA has contracted with a Servicing and Accounting Contractor and utilizes their proprietary-owned system to maintain records for all transactions relating to the assignment, servicing, and disposition of the MF notes portfolio. Each note is serviced in accordance with the mortgage and mortgage note documents. Servicing activities include billing, collections, disbursements, escrow management, and processing of terminations. Servicing activities are performed daily until termination of the note from the system. <br />
Taxes and R4R escrows are incorporated into the note and managed by the note. Amounts collected are all pre-determined by the language within the note itself. Payment amounts (R4R costs, insurance, taxes and miscellaneous A/P) are calculated based on invoices submitted. <br />
All disbursements are initially processed by the contractor. However, the Multifamily Notes Servicing Branch (MFNSB) staff have final approval on all disbursements. No disbursements are made by the contractor without approval from the MFNSB. Disbursements are approved by HUD. <br />
Each payment request has an invoice and physical approval. Separation of duties is maintained for the disbursement process. Contract staff create the transmittal to allow the disbursement; a second contract staff approves the transmittal; a third contract staff creates the disbursement. None of the staff have the authority to perform any other duty in the payment process. Upon receipt of the disbursement request from the contractor, it is reviewed by MFNSB staff to ensure the requested disbursement is correct and in compliance with HUD guidelines. Employees conduct data matching analytics to verify key information for disbursements such as project name, address, FHA number, iREMS number, and dollar amount. For payment schedules the Tax ID Number, Routing Number, Deposit Account Number, and Dollar Amount are validated against supporting documentation to ensure accuracy. <br />
Once the disbursements are reviewed and approved by MFNSB, they are sent to the Cash Management Branch (CMB) for certification and processing. Payments are disbursed directly to the vendor responsible for collecting the disbursement and applying the funds to the expense. Contract staff perform daily banking functions to ensure all checks have been cashed and ACH transactions processed. <br />
Once the Certifying Officer in CMB certifies the schedule for payment, CMB sends the Secure Payment System (SPS) Report via email to the MFNSB. Staff compares the schedule payment package to the daily SPS Report and to the Goal Report Agency Location Codes (ALC) Payment Details to ensure the payment information is correct. In addition, all cash activities are reconciled through monthly accounting reconciliations. These payments are also post payment checked <br />
On a monthly basis, the MFNSB Chief conducts random sampling of payment schedules. A sampling of 20% of paid schedules is selected and reviewed for accuracy of information and payment. There have been no inaccuracies or overpayments cited. In the event of an overpayment of taxes or hazard insurance, the contractor will work with the tax authority or insurance provider to recoup the overpayment. If the contractor is unable to recover the funds they will escalate the issue to MFNSB, which will work with the account executive, the Office of General Counsel, and the program area to ensure the overpayment is recaptured. In the event of an overpayment of R4R, the contractor will work with the management agent to recoup the overpayment. If the management agent fails to return the overpayment within 30 days, MFNSB will notify the account executive and program area. The overpayment will be included in the next scheduled billing statement and the management agent will be issued a formal notification of the action.<br />

Federal Housing Administration<br />
The Office of Housing-Federal Housing Administration’s (HSNG–FHA) recovery audit program is part of its overall program of effective internal control over payments. Internal control policies and procedures establishes a system to monitor improper payments and their causes, and includes controls and actions for detecting, preventing, and recovering improper payments. On a recurring basis, these programs generate reports that identify potentially duplicate disbursements. These disbursements are researched, and recovery actions are initiated for payments deemed improper. As part of the recapture audit plan, internal control documents and files are reviewed, and post claim reviews are performed.<br />
Under Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance Handbook 4740.2, the Financial Operation Center (FOC) is primarily responsible for generic debt collection and customer service activities, including responding to debtor inquiries regarding pay-off, payment plans, compromises, disputes, and appeals. The debt referral package primarily consists of copies of legal documents, mortgages, deeds of trust, judgments and other recorded lien documents, lien assignment documents, repayment agreements, credit reports, correspondence to/from debtors, and compromise agreements and supporting documents.<br />
The FOC is responsible for managing the business operations for the Title I loan program, which includes registering and endorsing loans for insurance, billing and collecting premiums, and examining claims for loss and approving them for payment. The FOC is also responsible for performing the debt collection and servicing activities for Title I Notes (defaulted Title I loans) and generic debts (other FHA debts).<br />
The Title I program authorizes HUD to insure lenders against default on loans used to finance property improvements and to purchase manufactured homes. Lenders are required to pay premiums covering the insurance of their loans and submit applications for insurance benefits for defaulted loans. HUD is required to collect the unpaid loan balance, including eligible expenses, from the defaulted borrower.<br />
The FOC’s Title I Insurance Processing Branch (TIIPB) is responsible for evaluating and approving lender applications for insurance benefits. The lender’s application must include loan information and any documentation necessary for the TIIPB to calculate a claim payment. There are three types of claim: initial, resubmitted, and supplemental. An initial claim is a first submission. A resubmitted claim is one that the TIIPB had previously denied. A supplemental claim is an additional claim for the same loan when the lender finds documentation for expenses not included in the initial claim. TIIPB support staff establish the claim in the Title I Insurance and Claims System (TIIS/F72). The process includes assigning a claim number, entering the date the claim was received, and assigning the claim to a TIIPB examiner. The examiner conducts a full review of the claim to determine whether the loan complies with Title I underwriting and servicing requirements and whether expenses claimed by the lender are supported by the documentation provided. If these conditions are satisfied, the examiner processes the claim calculation and authorization for payment in TIIS/F72. TIIS/F72 processes the payments authorized on the same day in a single batch file, sends the file to Treasury’s Payment Application Modernization system, and sends another file to the Cash Management Branch to authorize the Treasury disbursement. TIIS/F72 sends a file of paid claims to the Debt Collection and Management System – Title I (DCAMS-TI/F71), which converts the paid claims to notes receivable. The FOC’s Asset Recovery Division (ARD) is responsible for pursuing collection against the debtor (defaulted borrower).<br />
The TIIPB conducts quality reviews of paid Title I claims to ensure consistent processing and examination quality. Each month, the TIIPB Branch Chief randomly selects 10% of paid claims for review. The Branch Chief either reviews the claim themselves or assigns them to examiners for a peer review. The reviewer conducts a full examination of the claim and reports whether the claim payment was conforming (compliant/no deficiencies), deficient (minor issues to address), unacceptable (serious issues to address), or mitigated (issues found but readily resolved). The outcomes of quality reviews are documented in both the Case Notes screen of TIIS/F72 and in the Title I Quality Reviews folder of the FOC’s SharePoint site.<br />
If the review identified a deficiency that resulted in an overpaid claim, the TIIPB Branch Chief or examiner will issue a request to the lender for a full (for an unacceptable claim) or partial (for a deficient claim) repurchase of the loan. The request instructs the lender to repurchase the loan by remitting payment to a designated lockbox within 30 days or to ask for a reconsideration of the repurchase request within 10 days. If the lender fails to submit documentation that satisfactorily resolves the deficiency or to remit payment within the established timeframes, TIIPB issues a repurchase demand which gives the lender 30 days to remit the repurchase funds and informs the lender of the actions HUD will take if the funds aren’t remitted, including transferring the unpaid repurchase to the FOC’s ARD for delinquent debt collection, which includes referral to the Treasury Offset Program (TOP) for administrative offset.<br />
Both paid and unpaid repurchase requests and demands involve coordination between the FOC’s TIIPB and ARD. The ARD ensures that the Title I Note receivable is reclassified as a full or partial repurchase. Payments for full and partial repurchases are sent to the Title I Notes lockbox which transmits a collection file to DCAMS-TI/F71 to credit the funds to the Title I Note receivable associated with the claim. The ARD notifies the TIIPB when repurchase funds are received and the TIIPB updates the claim record in TIIS/F72 (subfunction J04). For full repurchases, the ARD closes the Title I Note receivable as repurchased. Before closing out the receivable, the ARD will issue the debtor (defaulted Title I borrower) a refund for any non-repurchase collections received. The TIIPB returns the original claim binder to the lender along with an executed reassignment of the Title I promissory note and lien, if applicable.<br />
Unpaid full or partial repurchase requests and demands are transferred to the ARD for delinquent debt collection. The ARD establishes a Title I Repurchase receivable in the Debt Collection and Asset Management System – Generic Debt (DCAMS-GD/F71A), which initiates the collection process by issuing an automated demand letter describing the debt and instructing the lender to remit payment in full within 30 days or contact the designated ARD Debt Servicing Representative (DSR) to request a plan to repay the debt in installments. If the lender does not pay the debt in full or enter a repayment plan within 30 days, DCAMS-GD/F71A issues a Notice of Intent (NOI) to Collect by Administrative Offset. The NOI notifies the lender that HUD intends to refer the debt to the TOP, describes the TOP process for administrative offset of federal payments, and provides the lender with steps to take to contest the basis of the debt or the amount demanded by filing an appeal with HUD’s Board of Appeals (BOA) within 65 days. If the lender files an appeal, DCAMS-GD/F71A suspends referral to TOP pending a decision and order from the BOA administrative law judge. (BOA adjudicates appeals by gathering and evaluating statements and documents from both parties.) If the BOA judge issues a decision and order declaring the debt unenforceable, the ARD closes the debt as unenforceable and notifies the TIIPB. The TIIPB will reverse the pending repurchase in TIIS/F72. If the decision and order results in a dismissal of the lender’s appeal, the DSR updates debt status in DCAMS-GD/F71A making the debt eligible for referral to TOP. DCAMS-GD/F71A refers eligible debts that are 121 or more days delinquent to TOP and the Treasury Cross-Servicing Program. DCAMS-GD/F71A also reports lenders to commercial credit reporting agencies (Dun & Bradstreet, Experian, and Equifax).<br />
The TIIPB may, rather than transfer the unpaid repurchase to the ARD for delinquent debt collection, pursue internal offset of payments on subsequent claims submitted by the lender. In most cases, however, it’s more effective to transfer the debt to the ARD, since any federal payment made to the lender, including Title I claim payments, will be collected through TOP.<br />
Collections, both voluntary and involuntary, received on a Title Repurchase debt are credited to the account. When a debt is paid in full, the ARD makes entries in DCAMS-GD/F71A to close out the debt as paid in full and to close out the Title I Note receivable as unenforceable. The TIIPB makes entries in TIIS/F72 (subfunction J04) to acknowledge satisfaction of the repurchase demand and returns the original claim binder to the lender along with an executed reassignment of the Title I Promissory Note and lien, if applicable.<br />
 If the ARD concludes that the Title I Repurchase debt is uncollectible, it takes steps to close out the debt in DCAMS-GD/F71A, which will issue an IRS Form 1099-C to the lender and report the debt accordingly to the IRS. The TIIPB will pursue secondary recovery activities on the uncollectible repurchase by internally offsetting future claims payments to the lender or blocking payments on subsequent claims submitted by the lender. The TIIPB may also refer the lender to FHA’s Mortgagee Review Board for sanctions<br />
The Debt Collection Asset Management System (DCAMS) is the application used to support the generic debt collection process. DCAMS is designed to automatically send collection letters, report delinquent debt to credit bureaus and HUD’s Credit Alert Interactive Voice Response System (CAIVRS), assess penalties and administrative costs, and refer eligible debts to the TOP and Cross-Servicing. Based on predefined criteria and the status of that case as reflected in DCAMS data fields (not later than 180 days after the demand letter), DCAMS is consistently updated to prevent improper referral for TOP offset.<br />
For internal offsets, over-claimed amounts (negative claims) occur when the mortgagee owes FHA. The Single-Family Claims Branch (SFCB) sends billing letters to lenders for the excess amounts claimed and tracks the receivables using the Accounts Receivables Sub-system (ARS). Receivables are established in SFCB’s ARS and identified by an FHA case number. Each FHA case number is further identified by Section of the Act (which is linked to the appropriate fund) and endorsement date. This later date identifies the cohort year. The Holder of record to which the claim funds were originally disbursed is identified in ARS as the debtor, by default. When the receivable is subsequently liquidated by funds remitted by a Mortgagee or by offset, the collected amount is posted to the previously identified FHA case number, Section of the Act, and cohort year.<br />
If a payment is not received from a lender within 90 days, the receivable is offset against subsequent claims by the lender until the full amount of the receivable is satisfied. If a receivable is not satisfied within 120-150 days, it is referred to the FOC in Albany, NY for enforced collection actions. At that time, the FOC officially confirms acceptance of the transfer of an aged delinquent debt, and that receivables have been removed from the ARS with the notation that it has been referred to the FOC for recovery.<br />
Another avenue by which improper payments are recaptured is through Post Claim Reviews for title II Single Family Insurance Claims. A statistical sample of settled claims is reviewed for compliance with FHA servicing and claim filing requirements. A report on findings, is prepared and issued to the individual mortgagee. Mortgagees can refute the findings by providing additional documents before a final report is issued. If the Mortgagee chooses to pay the monetary findings prior to HUD’s issuance of the final report, those funds are deposited to ARS, which applies them to the Mortgage Insurance (MI) fund. Upon issuance of the final report, it is referred to the FOC which establishes it as a receivable and tracks it until paid in full. If a lender is overpaid on a Multifamily claim, the Multifamily Claims Branch will demand the overage back from the lender, which is usually resolved within 30 days of final settlement. The mortgagee either returns the overpaid funds or files a supplemental claim. If the overpayment is not resolved within the 30-day or 60-day period after final settlement, the reviewer sends a follow-up letter at the end of each period advising the mortgagee of the penalties and interest assessed. If still not resolved after 90 days, the overpayment is electronically transferred to HUD’s FOC in Albany, New York for collection. Lastly, for Treasury Cross-Servicing, the collection of generic debt is governed by the Debt Collection Improvement Act and HUD policies (Title I and Other Debt Collection Guidance 4740.2). The Act requires federal agencies to refer eligible delinquent debts to Treasury (for Cross-Servicing and TOP) when the debt is 120 days delinquent.<br />
The Treasury’s TOP allows federal agencies to report delinquent non-tax debt to the BFS. BFS performs computer matching with disbursement data and processes an offset when an appropriate match is determined. After referral, Treasury and its private collection agencies are responsible for contacting the debtor to collect the payment of the debt. The Treasury’s Cross-Servicing is a process used by BFS to refer the debt collection to a private collection agency, among other actions, to collect delinquent debts on behalf of Federal Agencies.<br />
The FOC’s recapture process establishes receivables in DCAMS and issues a demand notice to the debtor(s). If the debt remains unpaid, DCAMS issues a “Notice of Intent” warning regarding enforced collection measures and informs the debtor regarding their due process rights. DCAMS automatically reports information to credit bureaus and CAIVRS. Penalty and administrative cost charges are also automatically assessed if warranted.<br />
If the debt remains unpaid, it is referred to Treasury (within 180 days) for offset via the government-wide TOP and for direct collection action by Treasury and Treasury contracted private collection agencies. Treasury also initiates referral to the Department of Justice (DOJ) for civil litigation and/or initiates Administrative Wage Garnishment (AWG) action if they deem such action to be appropriate.<br />
If Treasury’s Cross-Servicing action is not successful, Treasury “returns” the debt to the FOC. If older than two years, the receivable is written-off and the case is reclassified “currently not collectible.” The FOC keeps the case open if offset via TOP appears fruitful or if other collection measures are applicable (e.g., AWG action by HUD). Otherwise, the FOC terminates collection action, closes the case, and the system issues an IRS Form 1099C “Cancellation of Debt,” the following January if appropriate. Write-off, Termination, close-out, and 1099C issuance can also occur at any point in the above collection cycle if determined appropriate (e.g., debtor is discharged as bankrupt).<br />
Collections from debtors to HUD go to the Treasury Lockbox Network or Pay.gov. Collections from debtors to Treasury or DOJ come to HUD via interagency transfer (i.e., Intra-Governmental Payment and Collection (IPAC)). No matter the route, all payments are posted to the receivable in DCAMS.<br />
