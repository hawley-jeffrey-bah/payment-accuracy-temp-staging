                            OPM is committed to advancing a transparent, accountable, and collaborative financial management environment to fulfill its federal requirements and provide stakeholders with accessible and actionable<br />
financial information. An essential part of this commitment is the continuous improvement of payment accuracy in OPM’s programs and robust internal controls. OPM continues to implement solutions to<br />
prevent, detect, and reduce improper payments while reducing its stakeholders’ unnecessary administrative burden.<br />
<br />
OPM's Inspector General concluded that the agency was non-compliant with the Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) in the most recent compliance audit.<br />
<br />
PIIA requires the agency to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments. OPM conducts improper payment risk assessments on a three-year cycle, or more often if there are significant changes in the program. In FY 2023 OPM conducted improper payments risk assessments for four programs.  All programs analyzed this FY remained Phase I programs.  OPM continues to only have two Phase II programs; Retirement Services and Federal Employee Health Benefits Experience Rated Carriers.<br />
<br />
OPM's Retirement Services improper and unknown rate is 0.33 percent. The improper payment rate is 0.32 percent. The tolerable rate is 0.38 percent. RS is aware of the improper payment drivers; however, systemic limitations prevent RS from providing the survey's requested level of specificity. OPM’s systems were not designed or built to perform analyses of vast quantities of data. There are overpayments that are<br />
the result of annuitant's family members and other sources failing to report annuitant's death. However, as our on-going internal control activities, OPM conducts surveys and matches to mitigate potential improper payments resulting from these events. OPM conducts two matches to identify discrepancies that may exist between the OPM annuity roll and the Social Security Administration’s (SSA) pay system. The Consolidated Death Match (CDM) is compared with OPM’s annuity roll weekly to identify annuitants who are reported as deceased by SSA. The Validated Agency Match System processes the death information in order to terminate Federal benefits and prevent subsequent improper payments. Collection actions are initiated for any overpayments that are discovered. The SSA Death Master File (DMF) match is conducted yearly and is also compared with OPM’s annuity roll and the SSA Death Master File (DMF). OPM also utilizes Treasury's Do Not Pay Portal to identify annuitants that should have been reported as deceased.<br />
<br />
In the FY 2023 annual compliance audit, OPM OIG found that OPM’s FEHB Program was not in compliance with four of the ten PIIA reporting requirements:  <br />
1)	Published improper payment and unknown payment estimates for programs susceptible to significant improper payments and unknown payments in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.<br />
2)	Published corrective action plans for each program for which an estimate above the statutory threshold was published in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.<br />
3)	Demonstrated improvements to payment integrity or reached a tolerable improper payment and unknown payment rate.<br />
4)	Reported an improper payment and unknown payment estimate of less than 10 percent for each program for which an estimate was published in the accompanying materials to the annual financial statement.<br />
OPM is expeditiously implementing the actions needed for OPM to be compliant with PIIA reporting.  In FY 2022, OPM’s OCFO/Risk Management and Internal Controls (RMIC) office performed a risk assessment of the FEHB Program.  That risk assessment determined the FEHB Program was susceptible to significant improper payments, thus requiring OPM to report an IP estimate in FY 2023.  OPM immediately started developing a new improper payment methodology.  While developing the new methodology, OPM determined that the FEHB Program should be differentiated into two activities for OMB reporting purposes. The FEHB Program has different contracts, payment structures, and improper payment types for the Experience-Rated Carriers and Community Rated Carriers, meriting meaningfully different sampling and estimation methodology plans.  Off-cycle risk assessments were conducted for both new activities, with only the FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers determined susceptible to significant improper payments.  As the Community-Rated Carriers activity was not determined to be susceptible to significant improper payments, OPM is not required to report an improper and unknown payment estimate.<br />
<br />
OPM developed a new improper payment methodology in FY 2023 and actively engaged with agency stakeholders and FEHB Carriers to meet the PIIA requirements.   In FY 2024, OPM issued Carrier Letter 2024-15 Guidance on Audited Financial Statements for Federal Fiscal Year 2024. This Carrier Letter included the 2024 FEHBP Financial Reporting and Audit Guide, which provides detailed requirements for the financial reporting for all FEHB Experience-Rated carriers, including audit requirements and improper payment reporting. In FY 2024, OPM conducted training on the Financial Reporting and Audit Guide for all Experience-Rated Carriers and their Independent Public Accountants. OPM requires time to implement the new improper payment methodology, as the FEHB Experience-Rated Carriers need time to collect, audit, and report their data back to OPM. OPM anticipates being in compliance with PIIA in FY 2025.<br />
<br />
In addition to internal controls OPM uses and will continue to use training and audits to address improper payment issues.
