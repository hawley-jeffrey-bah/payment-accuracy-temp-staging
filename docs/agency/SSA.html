                        <h1>Social Security Administration</h1>
                        <p id="executive-summary-text" class="text-truncate">
                            The most recent Office of the Inspector General (OIG) Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) annual compliance audit was for fiscal year (FY) 2023.  In FY 2023, we had two programs reporting estimates above the statutory threshold, our Old-Age and Survivors, Disability Insurance (OASDI) and Supplemental Security Income (SSI) programs.  In the FY 2023 compliance audit, the Social Security OIG concluded the agency was compliant with nine PIIA reporting requirements, but we did not comply with one PIIA reporting requirement to demonstrate improvements to payment integrity or reach a tolerable improper payment and unknown payment rate for the OASDI and SSI programs.  The FY 2023 compliance audit report stated, “While SSA has made progress implementing corrective actions to address improper payments, it still has work to do.”  The FY 2023 compliance audit report included the following recommendation, “We recommend SSA finalize the IP [improper payments] alignment strategy for OASDI computations overpayment deficiency dollars.”<br />
<br />
The reporting period for this data call reflects FY 2024, and whether the agency is compliant will be determined in calendar year 2025.  PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs with annual outlays greater than $10,000,000 for improper payment risk at least once every three years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments.  Programs that are not likely to have an annual amount of improper payments plus annual unknown payments above the statutory threshold (which is either (a) both 1.5 percent of program outlays and $10,000,000 of all program payments made during the fiscal year, or (b) $100,000,000) are in Phase 1.  Per this definition, our Administrative Payments program is in Phase 1.  Our assessment of improper payment risk in our Administrative Payments program in FY 2024 determined that the program is not susceptible to significant improper payments.  We will conduct another improper payment risk assessment of our Administrative Payments program in FY 2027.  If a program in Phase 1 is likely to annually make improper payments and unknown payments above the statutory threshold, then the program will move into Phase 2 the following year.  Once in Phase 2 a program will have a different set of requirements such as reporting an annual improper payment and unknown payment estimate.  Our OASDI and SSI programs are in Phase 2.<br />
<br />
Based on our FY 2023 stewardship reviews (FY 2024 stewardship information will be available in summer 2025), we estimate that we paid approximately $1.4 trillion to OASDI beneficiaries.  Of that total, we estimate about $3.3 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 0.24 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $833.4 million, the equivalent of approximately 0.06 percent of outlays.  In the prior year reporting, based on our FY 2022 stewardship reviews, we estimate that we paid approximately $1.3 trillion to OASDI beneficiaries.  Of that total, we estimate about $6.5 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 0.51 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $1.8 billion, the equivalent of approximately 0.14 percent of outlays.  When comparing prior year reporting to this year's reporting, there has been a decrease in estimated overpayments ($6.5 billion to $3.3 billion) and underpayments ($1.8 billion to $833.4 million) in the OASDI program.<br />
<br />
OASDI overpayments within the agency’s control are due to our failure to access data or information needed.  These overpayments occur when the beneficiary or third-party provided data or information that we requested and was necessary to accurately compute the benefit amount, but we failed to use the data or information needed to validate the payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  To prevent these overpayments from occurring, technicians follow existing procedures and we provide training and reminders for technicians when applicable and automation solutions to improve accuracy when possible.<br />
<br />
OASDI overpayments outside of the agency’s control occur when we are unable to access data needed to validate payment accuracy because the beneficiary or a third-party either did not provide requested information or provided inaccurate information necessary to compute the accurate benefit amount.  The primary cause of these overpayments is our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment information.  From October 2023 through February 2024, we released social media posts on Facebook and Twitter sharing a link to our YouTube video to help beneficiaries learn about the importance of reporting wages and the automated electronic options for wage reporting.   To reduce our reliance on timely self-reporting of wage and employment information, we plan to utilize a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information from payroll data providers through an automated payroll information exchange (PIE), which we discuss later in this response.  Overall, we continue to have a high payment accuracy rate.<br />
<br />
Our greatest payment accuracy challenges occur within the SSI program.  SSI is a means-tested program for individuals with limited income and resources who are blind, disabled, or aged.  Administering the SSI program is complicated by the statutory requirement for us to determine SSI eligibility and calculate SSI payments monthly.  We generally make SSI payments on the first day of the month for eligibility in that month.  Many factors impact SSI payment accuracy.  Even if a payment was correct when paid, subsequent changes in that month can affect the payment due, resulting in either an overpayment or underpayment.  Thus, the program requirements sometimes make improper payments inevitable.  Improper payments often occur if recipients (or their representative payees) fail to timely report changes in any of their eligibility factors (e.g., an increase of their resources or a change in their wages).  Failure to report changes is the primary cause of both overpayments and underpayments.<br />
<br />
Based on our FY 2023 stewardship reviews (FY 2024 stewardship information will be available in summer 2025), we estimate that we paid approximately $61.0 billion to SSI recipients.  Of that total, we estimate about $5.6 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 9.18 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $877.9 million, the equivalent of approximately 1.44 percent of outlays.  In the prior year reporting, based on our FY 2022 stewardship reviews, we estimate that we paid approximately $57.6 billion to SSI recipients.  Of that total, we estimate about $4.6 billion were overpayments, representing approximately 8.02 percent of outlays.  We estimate that underpayments during this same period were $680.8 million, the equivalent of approximately 1.18 percent of outlays.  When comparing prior year reporting to this year’s reporting, there has been an increase in estimated overpayments ($4.6 billion to $5.6 billion) and underpayments ($680.8 million to $877.9 million) in the SSI program.<br />
<br />
Of the estimated $5.6 billion in SSI overpayments, approximately $5.3 billion was due to factors outside of the agency’s control because the data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making payment does not exist or is inaccessible to us.  The primary cause of these overpayments is reliance on timely self-reporting of financial accounts over the countable resource limit and employment and wage information.  In March 2024, we released a Dear Colleague Letter to advocates reminding them about SSI reporting responsibilities and the importance of ensuring we have current contact information.  In April 2024, we released a blog that explains to SSI recipients the importance of reporting their financial accounts.  The blog provides examples of financial accounts and informs the reader about Achieving a Better Life Experience accounts.  In general, to address the root causes due to factors outside of agency’s control, we conduct quality reviews and cost-effective program integrity work including SSI non-medical redeterminations.  Additionally, to reduce the reliance on self-reporting, we continue to expand and pursue new data exchange partners from government and private sectors.<br />
<br />
Additionally, to help mitigate OASDI and SSI improper payments related to wages, we developed a new wage reporting option where we receive wage and employment information from a payroll data provider through an automated PIE.  In February 2024, we published a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking describing the agency’s plans for accessing and using information from payroll data providers to reduce improper payments (overpayments and underpayments), which improves service to customers.  The public comment period closed on April 15, 2024.  We are carefully considering the comments as we draft the final rule, which is currently planned for publication in winter of FY 2025.  In FY 2024, we completed the automated PIE wage reporting notices and created a limited issue diary to alert technicians when incoming wage and employment information from PIE doesn't automatically post to the SSI record, requiring manual review and action.  We plan to implement PIE in Spring 2025 through a phased approach after a final rule is published.  We continue to work on training, marketing, designing a phased approach, and updating policy in preparation for implementation.<br />
<br />
Approximately $346.7 million in SSI overpayments were within the agency’s control and due to our failure to access data or information to validate payment accuracy prior to making a payment.  The primary causes of these overpayments are incorrectly computing the payment or failure to obtain or act on available information affecting the payment.  We are addressing this root cause by investing in information technology modernization to provide our employees with user-friendly systems and tools.  To meet the challenges of our growing workloads and provide the best service possible, we are streamlining our policies and procedures, issuing reminders to technicians, and automating more of our business processes.<br />
<br />
We implemented the Improper Payments Alignment Strategies (IPAS) to focus on our corrective actions to address the root causes of improper payments in both the OASDI and SSI programs.  As part of our IPAS, we evaluate the effectiveness of each completed mitigation initiative.  Additionally, we determine the most cost-effective strategies to remediate the underlying causes of payment errors and monitor, measure, and revise the strategies as needed.  In FY 2024, we completed the evaluation of completed actions on financial accounts and in-kind support and maintenance.  In FY 2025, we will draft a new IPAS on relationship and OASDI computations.<br />

                            Historically, our remittance process was a largely manual workload handled by the Mid-Atlantic Program Service Center (MATPSC).  The MATPSC remittance process requires a method of payment (check, money order, debit or credit card) and a corresponding payment coupon necessary to update a debtor’s record.  In fiscal year (FY) 2021, as part of the Debt Management Product, we implemented several improvements to our remittance process.  In FY 2021, we started accepting repayment of benefit overpayments through the Department of the Treasury’s (Treasury) Pay.gov via credit or debit card and automated clearing house (ACH); i.e., a checking or savings account.  In addition to this effort, we partnered with Treasury to use U.S. Bank, a financial agent for Treasury, to implement a lockbox service to assist with our paper remittance processing efforts at the MATPSC.  Lastly, we implemented Online Bill Pay (OLBP), allowing debtors to make a one-time or recurring ACH draft from a bank account using a personal computer or mobile phone.  In FY 2023, we extended the lockbox service to include Supplemental Security Income remittances.  These enhancements now account for approximately 51 percent of our remittance activity.<br />
<br />
In FY 2024, we processed over 469,000 remittances and collected over $94 million through Pay.gov; we processed approximately 195,000 remittances and collected over $56 million through the lockbox service; and we processed over 49,000 remittances and collected over $5 million through the OLBP.<br />
