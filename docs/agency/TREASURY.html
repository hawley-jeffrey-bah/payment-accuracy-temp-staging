                            Treasury programs in phase 1 are required to complete a PIIA risk assessment once every three years. The years in between risk assessments, we require programs to complete a certification which states there has been no major changes to program funding or legislation that could impact the risk of improper payments. In FY 24, 34 programs completed a risk assessment. Of these 34 risk assessments, 31 were found not susceptible to significant improper payments and three were found susceptible to significant improper payments. The three programs that were found susceptible to significant improper payments were the Emergency Rental Assistance (ERA), Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) US Coronavirus Payments, and IRS US Coronavirus Refundable Credits. These three COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, along with two other COVID-19 pandemic relief program, IRS Child and Dependent Care Tax Credit and Air Carrier Payroll Support Programs (PSP), also known as Pandemic Relief for Aviation Workers, were determined to be susceptible to improper payments in previous years. However, in August 2022 Treasury determined that due to the short-term nature of these programs, quantifying the amount and rate of improper payments, assessing the root cause, and developing corrective action plans to reduce payment errors in the future would provide minimal value and be an ineffective use of resources. Therefore, for its COVID-19 pandemic relief programs, Treasury decided it would not report an improper payment estimate either in its Agency Financial Report or on paymentaccuracy.gov. These programs remain in the risk assessment rotation.<br />
<br />
Treasury reports error rates as outlined in the PIIA and OMB Appendix C, for four refundable tax credits (RTCs)—the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC), American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC), Additional Child Tax Credit (ACTC), and net Premium Tax Credit (PTC). <br />
<br />
The root cause of the errors in the EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and net PTC RTCs is not the result of internal control deficiencies and, as such, the IRS has continuously deployed costly tools to in effort to lower the error rate. These tools include training, such as the nationwide tax forum, due diligence training module and webinars, cross enterprise sharing with other Federal agencies, and change processes such as hosting annual Dependent Database meetings with stakeholders to adjust the value of prior-year compliance filters for audit selection of returns claiming the RTCs and identifying improvement opportunities for the filing season. Deployment of enforcement tools has had minimal impact on lowering the error rate. The IRS continues significant efforts to bring its improper payment rate for these RTC programs to less than 10 percent.<br />
<br />
Treasury was found non-compliant with 2 of the 10 PIIA reporting requirements for FY23. Specifically, Treasury did not adequately conclude whether programs are likely to make Improper Payments (IPs) and Unknown Payments (UPs) above or below the statutory threshold for the ERA and PSP pandemic relief programs; and did not comply with the requirement to report an improper payment rate of less than 10 percent for four the IRS RTC programs mentioned above (EITC, AOTC, ACTC, and Net PTC). Treasury complied with the remaining eight PIIA requirements. Treasury corrective action plans to bring ERA and PSP into compliance by May 2025. While the improper payment rates did decrease in EITC, AOTC, and ACTC, it remains a significant challenge to bring the RTC programs into compliance with the PIIA without significant legislative action and restructuring.

                        Invoices processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) are subject to a monthly post payment audit of 10% of the total paid IPP invoices for that month.  Invoices not processed through the Invoice Processing Platform (IPP) in excess of $2,500.00 are subject to secondary review before being paid.  Invoices under $2,500.00 are subject to review through statistical sampling procedures.  Travel vouchers processed through the Concur Government Edition (CGE) travel system are subject to a post payment audit based on a random sample of all reimbursements under $2,500.   All payments of $2,500.00 and higher are excluded from the population. These payments require a 100% post payment audit review. Relocation vouchers processed through the MoveLINQ system are subject to 100% pre-payment audit and review. For payment customers, once the vouchers have been pre-audited and approved for payment they are interfaced to Oracle the financial system where they are paid. <br />

The DNP portal implementation has provided a way bureau's/office's procurement and payable offices to review vendor files prior to disbursement.  It has also given them an opportunity to review the monthly payment file results to identify any improper payments made to a vendor in the DNP portal.
