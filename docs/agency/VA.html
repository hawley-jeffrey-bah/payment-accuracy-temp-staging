                            VA has made great progress in the reduction of improper and unknown payments as it continues to implement Payment Integrity Information Act of 2019 (PIIA) requirements. Since FY 2018, VA has reduced improper and unknown payments by $12.6 billion, or 85% and removed a total of 7 programs from reporting requirements, utilizing mitigation strategies and corrective actions that prioritized the largest proportion of errors and noncompliance with laws and regulations. In FY 2024, VA is also pleased to announce that the Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents program is reporting under the statutory thresholds and will be removed from reporting requirements in FY 2025.<br />
<br />
PIIA requires agencies to review and assess all programs and activities with annual outlays greater than $10 million for improper payment risk at least once every 3 years to identify those susceptible to significant improper payments. In addition, VA conducts off-cycle improper payment risk assessments when a significant change in legislation and/or a significant change in funding occurs as required by Office of Management and Budget. For FY 2024, VA is reporting 65 programs subject to risk assessment requirements with 24 programs completing an improper and unknown payment risk assessment. Of these, 23 programs, or 96%, were determined unlikely to be at significant risk of improper and unknown payments, defined as $10 million and 1.5% of outlays or $100 million in total. The Compensation program improper payment risk assessment results determined the program is likely to be at significant risk of improper and unknown payments. As a result, the Compensation program will report a statistically valid projection in FY 2025. In addition, in accordance with Office of Management and Budget guidance, 3 new programs identified during FY 2024 will initiate the 3-year risk assessment cycle early in FY 2025.<br />
<br />
For those programs determined to be at risk of significant improper and unknown payments in the previous year, PIIA requires agencies to follow OMB implementation guidance for testing, reporting, and remediating improper and unknown payments. For FY 2024, VA is reporting a total of $2.2 billion in projected improper and unknown payments across 7 programs: Beneficiary Travel; Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents; Medical Care Contracts and Agreements; Pension; Purchased Long Term Services and Supports; Supplies and Materials; and VA Community Care. Specifically, VA reports $1.1 billion in monetary loss, $731.5 million in non-monetary loss improper payments ($32.6 million in underpayments, $698.9 million in technically improper), and $328.0 million in unknown payments. From FY 2023 to FY 2024, VA is reporting a reduction in monetary loss of $681.6 million or 38%. VAâ€™s reported improper and unknown payments is a reduction of about $1 billion or 32% from FY 2023 results and is VAâ€™s sixth consecutive year of reported reductions. It is important to note that VA efforts to reduce improper and unknown payments outpaced overall outlay increases of $4.4 billion in FY 2024, or 12%, due to effective corrective actions and mitigation strategies.                                                              <br />
<br />
For FY 2024, 4 VA programs (Communications, Utilities, and Other Rents, Medical Care Contracts and Agreements, Purchased Long Term Services and Supports, and VA Community Care) achieved a reduction in their improper and unknown payment rates and amounts. The remaining 3 programs (Beneficiary Travel, Pension, and Supplies and Materials) reported an increase; however, these programs did make improvements in FY 2024 that will reduce future improper and unknown payments. Reductions to overall improper and unknown payments is attributed to VAâ€™s robust process to update corrective action plans annually based on testing results, and no less than quarterly throughout the fiscal year, to ensure actions are appropriately prioritized and designed to mitigate risks of improper and unknown payments. Effectiveness reviews are also conducted annually to measure if actions reduced or were properly designed to reduce improper and unknown payments using set benchmarks for specific root causes.<br />
<br />
In FY 2024, VAâ€™s highest contributors of monetary losses were within VAâ€™s control and occurred when programs failed to access the data/information needed to validate correct beneficiary award amounts or that claims were paid in accordance with contract rates. These errors accounted for $594.8 million, or 27% of VAâ€™s total improper and unknown payments. To remediate these errors, VA will continue to implement actions that include identifying variances between reported Social Security Administration income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. In addition, VA will clarify payment methodology, ensure that invoices are paid per the contract pricing, and implement system updates to ensure claims are paid appropriately. <br />
<br />
In FY 2024, VA's highest contributor of technically improper payments did not meet statutory or regulatory requirements because purchases were made without a contract utilizing a Basic Ordering Agreement or VA was missing written documentation to support ordering officer delegations. These errors accounted for $511.9 million, or 24% of VA's total improper and unknown payments. To remediate these errors, VA will continue to implement short- and long-term contracting options to improve compliance with procurement requirements and will improve contract processes to ensure payment accuracy.<br />
<br />
In FY 2024, VAâ€™s Inspector General concluded that the agency was noncompliant with PIIA. VA was noncompliant because the improper and unknown payment rate in two programs, Pension and Purchased Long Term Services and Supports, was greater than 10%. The Pension program will conduct quarterly matches with the Social Security Administration to identify variances in income amounts between Social Security income a beneficiary is receiving versus the amounts reported by a beneficiary to VA. In addition, the program will randomly review claims processorsâ€™ work and train staff to ensure policies and procedures are properly applied in making accurate pension rate decisions to prevent future improper payments. The Purchased Long Term Services and Supports program plans to move to a standardized rate schedule to transition Community Nursing Home payments to an automated claims processing system; update the claims processing system to pay claims appropriately; continue clarifying payment methodology with third-party administrators to bill at the correct rates; continue implementing short- and long-term contracting options for Community Nursing Home payments to improve compliance with procurement requirements; and provide education and training to resolve missing documentation errors. The agency anticipates the Office of Inspector General will determine the Pension program compliant in May 2027 and the PLTSS program compliant in May 2028.

                            VA's recovery response is provided at the agency level based on an aggregate of program specific data. As a result, individual program responses may not be reflective of the overall agency response. For example, while VA responded yes to recovery audits, only 21 of 81 programs performed recovery audits. <br />
<br />
Due to technical issues, the Defense Finance and Accounting Service payroll recovery results only include recovered amounts for the overpayments identified in FY24. Therefore, VA Wide Payroll recoveries included in reporting do not include amounts recovered for improper payments identified in prior reporting periods.<br />
<br />
Agency wide totals for the disposition of funds are able to be reconciled to the recovery audit amount for the reporting period; however, recovery audit overpayments identified in the current reporting period that remain outstanding for zero to six months or six months to one year may not reconcile to the difference in the amount identified and amount recovered for the current reporting period. This is a result of the amount recovered in the current reporting period including overpayments identified both within the reporting period and from prior reporting periods.

                        <h5>Methods Currently Used to Recover Overpayments Identified in Recovery Audits</h5>
                        <br />
                        VA has established recovery audits in a manner that maximizes efficiency; therefore, many programs payments are audited for overpayments that can be recovered using the same processes and procedures. These are discussed in more detail below.<br />
<br />
Veterans Health Administration<br />
<br />
The Veterans Health Administration utilizes a recovery audit contract, which will audit claims for the Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs, VA Community Care, and Spina Bifida programs.  All three programs were tested to ensure the reimbursement was based on the appropriate methodology and that the medical records support the diagnostic related group billed for the services.  The VA Community Care review also includes pre-authorized claims paid under 38 United States Code Â§ 1703 (authorized care) and will test to ensure the care rendered is in compliance with the authorization/referral.<br />
<br />
Veterans Benefits Administration<br />
<br />
The Veterans Benefits Administration uses a combination of quality reviews and payment reviews to identify possible duplicates and overpayments. The majority of Veterans Benefits Administration programs perform quality reviews on randomly selected cases that ensure eligibility determinations, proper case processing, and payment accuracy. For all other programs, Veterans Benefits Administration performs payment reviews to identify potential duplicate payments and other potential overpayments. Veterans Benefits Administration tracks, monitors, and recovers overpayments eligible for recovery through combined efforts of the Debt Management Center, the Administrative and Loan Accounting Center, and Regional Offices. <br />
<br />
Office of Revolving Funds<br />
<br />
The Office of Revolving Funds collaborates with the Office of Inspector General to perform recovery audits on VA's Supply Fund program. The Office of Inspector General identifies an overpayment and a bill of collection is then prepared by the Office of Revolving Funds with appropriate terms of collection. If the vendor chooses to dispute the bill of collection Veterans Affairs will work towards appropriate resolution.
